 COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date

Grace hopper being credited for COBOL:
1954: Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. 

1959: she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language.

"the grandmother of cobol"

Hopper is sometimes referred to as "the mother of COBOL" or "the grandmother of COBOL",[34][35][36] although Jean Sammet, a lead designer of COBOL, stated that Hopper "was not the mother, creator or developer of Cobol".[37][1]

Plenty of companies still use COBOL, including IBM, UPS, and Cigna. Mario Ceballos, a software engineer at Cigna, told me, “The syntax is kept simple to allow non-programmers (“The Business”) to read it and understand it. COBOL is meant to be explicit, because there shouldn’t be room for assumptions.”

Of course, it has had its critics. In 1975, Edsgar Dijkstra famously proclaimed that “The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offence[sic].” This undoubtedly led to the decline of teaching COBOL in universities, but it remained the dominant business language.

if you look "CObol" up on google, it is very negative sentiment, ex the knowledge panel asks "why is cobol hated"

"When people mention COBOL, it's usually either met with a snort or groan. I don't know much about COBOL, but I've seen some programs written in it. I can see that it's wordy, and to uninitiated eyes such as mine, unintelligible. But, really, aren't all programming languages complete gibberish to a lay person?" https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/112911/why-the-scorn-for-cobol

Was COBOL the first programming language used in financial, stock and banking systems?

Well known languages that co-existed with early COBOL are Fortran and Lisp. These languages were not much used much outside of research and university facilities.

The landscape was highly fragmented within the world of business computing. A number of proprietary low-to-medium level languages existed but generally only ran on one vendors machine. A few examples were: FLO-MATIC, AIMACO and COMTRAN, all of which heavily influenced the development of COBOL.

From this chaos emerged a strong desire to have a machine independent and common language for developing business applications.

According to Jean E. Sammet (The Early History of COBOL), the *US Department of Defense spearheaded and funded the early development of COBOL.*
