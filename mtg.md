feminist imagine allteratnves
path dependent nature of institutional development
- denaturalize assumptions 
eelizabeth hinton


developd nations owning things that are unfairly distributed over the globe. legal scholarship: reinvention of idea of jurisdiction. jurisdiction = what court has authorty. no longer a spatial/administrative attribute, but the question of who actually has power on the ground. jurisidiction can belong to someone who is not legally appointed. microsoft rent-to-use. conversation about studying the same problem: person in charge of organizing your shit in day-to-day is the one who has jurisiction. technological and military infrastructure have blended. can i think about what is counted, what is stored as technologies that are shared across these spaces that conflate and combine military or technological approaches. think about why it matters. china as a counter-example. how horrible it is that CCP is using surveillance to surveil ppl. meaningfully ask what is the diff. Google vs CCP. Bitcoin: doing a ton of computing in other places. 

- critical read of a single sort of code
- for the ppl tryin to solve this problem, these r the steps 
historically, lets look at these choices and denaturalize the supposedly natural nature
- recontextualize inside a longer history of surveillance and analysis
- 
not every piece of scholarship has to be polemic
- questions being asked at the cutting edge of the field
- physically and fiscally , how can we imagine it being structured differently
- not political or plemic

power, authority, complicity of the programmer 
- practical, show me that it matters
CC taking a current example and tracing it back

technology/institutional feature that is rooted in military
- taking stock of where it shows up in current technologies
    - e.g. surveillance, GPS, the ways in which this military technology has proliferated. if and how it matters that these thigns have military origins

US vs CHINA: ppl are so quick to presume that china is evil and that there is nothing u can do about google and FB

PUBLIC DISCOURSE TACK:
- the economist reporting about china
    - congressional discussions (political issues)
        - us congressional hearings on the monitoring and imprisonment of uighurs in china
        - amnesty international human rights report on Google and FB
            - the language used is parallel to the ^china
    - open sesame social credit scoring
        - talking heads
            - domestic surveillance
ACADMEIC DISCOURSE TACK:
- presidential addresses, foreign policy journals, what are the people whose opinions matter saying about what we should do about each of these things
- industry focus: what does zucky say about china. 
    - google/china battle. what is google fighting to do, and how is it different from what china has to do? r they both trying to do thing
        - 2009 episode rereading: uniformly portrayed in american media as communist government refusing free internet. 
            - could be reread as 2 parties, both want to control the internet
            - links to free speech favoring/privacy favorign things 
            - thinking of ways that they frame their relationships in contrast to the ways that china is portrayed
        - laws in china
            - probably translated into english
            - thinking about legal interpreattions could be an interesting way
            - interseting way of thinking about the regulatory future of these things
            - chinas decisions of how to establish control over these systems. alternative regulatory frameworks
- weibo theorizing american empire. uniformly held opinion that they were orchestrated by american agents
    - american agents are trying to undermine china. 
- not particularly about google/fb
- irony: the more you know, the less sure you can be that you know anything
    - cambridge analytic, right wing FB angle: ways in which military and surveillance-oriented underpinnings of these technologies are inherently insane. can produce these increasingly odd/out-of-control realities out of data
    - when surveillance drives AI, being seen is more important than being
russian bots, wu mao, etc. when surveillance is the method through which information is generated, all you have to do is surveileld in order to b

the more sources of info exist, and the broader inputs that these analyses rely, the more cooks there ar ein the information ktichen
- ppl didnt ahve more of an idea tof what was going on
- generate these narratives
superproliferation of ways of generating proliferations


historians can change the questions in ppls faces
1. how are these technologies rooted in military
    1. make something that seems like it was immoveable, and make it an option that was taken in history
increasing the number of questions that ppl can ask about what ppl should do and what people can do
- alternative narratives, parallel narratives, creating new routes of inquiry and action

write up the summary of topic for warren by next week
by week 10: (3 mtgs from now)
- make a list of 3 possible topics
ur project is goign to be some node in the web of thoughts that youâ€™re constructing
	- potential spots by maura
	- start thinking about which intersections would be the most 

archives:
- jumping into an abyss and hoping that there is something there
- cant approximate how easy or hard a project is going to be


- read what other ppl are doing and recognize why i dont like it

closed world:
- more straightfoward

make a list of ways in which ppl suggest military involvement matters, sorts of examples that they use, and whether or not that is satisfying
- historiographical framing
- it matters that the military funded AI
    - here's the lens that I use, and you can own all of that work. what do ppl mean, what evidence do they give
    - history powerful: tell a story, tell u what to think based on the story

think about alternatives, what else might AI look like? take advantage of position inside industry
- counterfactuals
    - ai could look like this if it wasn't designed by these people

# mtg 4/1

Q: do we care about normalizing stuff

think about these questions as an insider
conflicts b/w/n rigors of academic standards, vs corporations, vs critique of ppl

philosophical and extra reading
- doing another layer of extra thoughts and questions
- implications of the work 

u can show that rockefeller has these goals, and milikan had these ideas, but how did it ahve an impact on the science that was produced, and if there could have been another science

- where is there an isntance that these connections do matter
    - its not rly a dirty secret, it's more polemical
        just bc it has the origins of something, then it always bears the mark of that thing

- talk to ppl, think through these things
    - when and where and whether does this matter

- focusing on a thing that matters

- socially, institutionally, all these things exist
--> lets look at this specific project and think through how all these things do or dont get done


- the ways that we think and talk about ai fairness are so wacky!
    - how are some of the ways .. predicated on the fact that we're selling things to fairness, consumers who we presume are rational, and have no other traits
    - critique this with more predictable approaches

*THINK about WHEN THIS ACTUALLY MATTERS.*
    - the better arg is not the one that promises to answer everything. but the one that shows that something matters in a demonstrable manner

*CONCRETELY*:
ur doing a history project.
- why does history matter? how can we use it to help ppl to have conversations about just ways to help ? and ways to exist in these spaces.
    - whether and when history matters to the context of what ppl think they sohuld be doing

- here's why every major tech company has a small battalion of woke intellectuals and heres the 3 reasons systemically these projects can only go so far

    - the SS does not exist only to serve the computing
    - within the company : SS 
    more social research driven development
WarGames

the ways that ppl can be used for good
- passive recognition of the fact that it's used for not-good
- what are the ways that ppl think that tech is good. how does this generate correctives. 
    - who started CS for social good? 
        - always a reaction to CS for war. 

revisionist history | orthodox history | constantly cannabalizing one another
- What does CS revisionism look like? who gets to change the narratives and norms and pursuits of the ? what tech is for and whats good and whats bad

whats ethical vs not ethical in data
- has completely shifted
    - by the movement of big data into the corporate and private sphere
    - convos about how much data it was feasible whe nwe're talking about the state vs corporate
surveilalnce in china vs surveillance in US
    - for-profit, so presume that it has no sinister, powerful backing

relationship b/w govt pushing into sphere of development and the active interests 
- collapsed these nuanced ethical qs into -> should the govt do it or sohuld corporations do it? . becomes who should be colelcting the data?
    - it would be much worse if the govt is doing it. at least we're only doing it for profit, at least we r keeping ur name private
        - industry shaped in conversation with government

why AI? why exactly this set of problems? IBM and lincoln lab
- charismatic PIs who are constantly hustling
    - document the rise of a subfield and what it relies upon
    - why do we use this tool for everything
    - help us think through these things

situate class, race, etc inside these spaces
- AI get the most applause at a poetry slam
- AI for humor 
    - it frames our idea of what AI can do. it shapes the way that we think it can do.

what traits are AI doing?

*why is AI all about prediction?*
    - take a rly important problem
    - CV as modern phrenology

propublica recidivism
    - try to trace, before the algorithm, the collection of data that is used to train it, and critically parse out who is collecting this data, for what,

        - heres how to crtiically read a dataset, here r the questions
        - if you want to say tat u didnt make the data, you're just using it. but u have to be able to account for externalities

what data actually are they talking about
    - before corporations were collecting this data, who was?
    - where is all of the inherited data coming from? what is the relationship between where theyre comign from and how theyre used?
    govt -> corporate

the ways in which the answer to your question is more about your question than your observation

statistics comes from "state"

- dont spend millions of man hours to gather data because its fun. u do it to answer questions

structures that gather together large pieces of data
- tied to prediction and managing populations and resources

observe your actor's categories
-  languages and frameworks that her subjects are thinking of it
- anthropoligical opportunity to directly interrogate them (SECRETLY ;-) )

hear ppl talk about these problems: where are their assumptions? what are the axioms that they are operating from? in industry?
- industry fairness 


TASK: observe your actor's categories.


## questions to think about
- why does history matter? how can we use it to help ppl to have conversations about just ways to help ? and ways to exist in these spaces?
    - whether and when history matters to the context of what ppl think they sohuld be doing

    - implications???

    - marginalize 

- What does CS revisionism look like? who gets to change the narratives and norms and pursuits of the ? what tech is for and whats good and whats bad
- what are the ways that ppl think that tech is good. how does this generate correctives. 
    - who started CS for social good? / cs fairness?
        - always a reaction to CS for war. 

## other qs to explore [concretely]
*why is AI all about prediction?*
    - take a rly important problem
    - CV as modern phrenology

- TODO propublica recidivism
    - try to trace, before the algorithm, the collection of data that is used to train it, and critically parse out who is collecting this data, for what,
