# project description

- when did corporations start caring about analyzing behavior

- spreadsheet of how google is funding rsrch

- who was funding john mccarthy?


- how AI was started/motivated by desire for social control since it was funded by ppl who are trying to figure out human behavior

- CORPORATION partnerships

## march 18

- basically, i want to look specifically at the origins of these places. and then the argument that it leads into the present day is kind of more of a conclusion. like these partnerships have always existed.
- incorporating bourne / nationalism / etc?
- also possibly related to eugenics and the desire for control and stuff, like it originated from the same behavior workshop
- structure:



Partnerships between corporations and universities in conducting research and making progress are commonplace in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science, from research centers funded entirely by Big Tech to professors holding full-time industry positions.

Corporate interests shape the directions of universities' artificial intelligence and machine learning research, challenging the research university's image as an ivory tower devoted to knowledge for knowledge's sake.

I argue that this relationship is not a radical departure from the previous structure of the university as an "institution of objective higher learning” but rather a natural continuation of the university's political and economic connections. Using the examples of Caltech, Stanford, and Berkeley, I focus on the origins of these research topics in the _70's? 80's?_ as arising from electrical engineering, a field that has been heavily shaped by the partnerships between military, academia, and cooperations, i.e. the  “Military-Industrial-Academic Complex”, well before the existence of artificial intelligence.

The inextricable ties among these actors during World War II and the Cold War illuminates how the structures of these partnerships shape research intentions as well as the discoveries' societal implications well into the current day.





fields from electrical engineering to molecular biology to social science have been shaped by 
at Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley as case studies. I show how data science arose

In all three universities, these fields are closely connected to electrical engineering, 

illuminates how the structures of these partnerships shape not only the research directions and discoveries made but also their societal implications


I draw upon the ways in which especially during wartime. The idea of the “Military-Industrial-Academic Complex” in the 20th century illuminates how the structures of these partnerships shape not only the research directions and discoveries made but also their societal implications and the ways that they are used.



 position of power as it relates to the *political economy - in the 20th century, the political economy/power was shaped by World War II, the Cold War, etc. Now, it is shaped by individualization and big tech companies.* 





## march 4
I am curious about the partnerships between corporations and academia in conducting research and making progress in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

I explore these relationships using analytical frameworks of *consensus formation and cultural hegemony*, using ideas from Bourne, Beard, and others - science/technology universities are framed as searching for scientific truth while, in reality, satisfying external actors. How do the current structures compare to the ideal of the former while contributing to the latter?

* /^This paragraph lives in the conclusion. Not a work that is primarily critical./ 

Moreover, has the scientific university ever followed this ideal? The current structure is not so much an egregious, radical departure from the previous structure of the university as an” institution of objective higher learning” but rather a natural continuation of its position of power as it relates to the *political economy - in the 20th century, the political economy/power was shaped by World War II, the Cold War, etc. Now, it is shaped by individualization and big tech companies.* 
	
* *Individualization* or *Individuated?*
	* Opposite of mobilization in WWII: uniformizing/mass mobiliziation.
		* How these technologies have some ways opposite objectives. Even though the frameworks that theyre emerging from are analogous
	* Is part of why we dont recognize the effect of corporate/university alliance in the same way that we recognize it in WWII context due to the fact that these technologies are refractive/alienated/personally beneficial
		* Why this phenomenon is difficult to sense
	* In political economy, how do the rulers of society organize it, how do the rest of us sit inside of it. Top-down approach. That is what we’re thinking about (corporate/university create the structures/systems that we sit inside of)
	* Bottom-up political economy: each individual imagines themselves as the ruler of their universe but in fact theyre at the other end of the system.
		* Commercialization in mid-century era, asking this from other direction
			* Professors in humanities @ caltech: ethics and tech issues: 
				* Tendencies to think of Im just one person, i cant change the system, you cant blame someone for making 1 algorithm
				* The modular way that data functions poses a particular problem of political economy
				* We could close down tyson, but what does that even mean in this context?

I draw upon the ways in which fields from electrical engineering to molecular biology to social science have been shaped by the partnerships between military, academia, and cooperations, especially during wartime. The idea of the “Military-Industrial-Academic Complex” in the 20th century illuminates how the structures of these partnerships shape not only the research directions and discoveries made but also their societal implications and the ways that they are used.


Focus on a few specific universities: Stanford, MIT, Caltech, CMU, Berkeley? Microsoft, Google? A
macro/micro? Comparative perspectives between them?
